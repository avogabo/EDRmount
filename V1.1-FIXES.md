# EDRmount — V1.1 Fixes / Backlog

> Curated from previous long sessions (sessionsBAK). Keep this file as the durable “what to fix next” list.

## P0 (first items)

1) **First-run bootstrap: create a blank config if missing**
   - Problem: container currently expects `/config/config.json` to exist; otherwise it fails fast.
   - Desired: on first run, if `/config/config.json` doesn’t exist, create a minimal default config (safe, no secrets) so the service boots and user can finish setup via UI.
   - Also consider: create required folders under host root (inbox) if missing.

2) **Docs/UX: clarify path mapping and “what is raw vs nzb inbox”**
   - Confusion reported: whether `/host/inbox/nzb` equals the same thing as the FUSE `raw` view, and what `:rshared` actually affects.
   - Add explicit section to README:
     - `/host` is the bind-mapped host root.
     - `/host/inbox/nzb` is an input directory for `.nzb` files.
     - `/host/mount/raw` is a FUSE-mounted virtual view (output), not the inbox.
     - Explain `:rshared` requirement and why.

3) **Fix/avoid `raw/raw` path duplication in UI or navigation**
   - Reported symptom: the path appears as `raw/raw` (duplicate level) somewhere.
   - Likely sources: UI routing, API prefixing, or filesystem root exposing `raw` twice.
   - Add a reproducible case + fix.

## Known good concepts (to keep consistent)

- FUSE mounts created by the service (under `mount_point`):
  - `raw`
  - `library-auto`
  - `library-manual`

- Recommended binds (generic):
  - Host appdata/config -> `/config`
  - Host data root -> `/host` (use `:rshared` on Unraid)
  - Fast cache -> `/cache`

## Notes / reminders

- Do not commit secrets into repo (NNTP creds, tokens, etc.).
- When discussing configs, use `config.sample.json` / placeholders.
